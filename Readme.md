# Coding With Mosh Design Patterns

## Momento Pattern
 The Memento Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to save its state and to restore it later. This pattern is useful for implementing undo mechanisms. It involves three main components: the Originator (the object whose state needs to be saved), the Memento (the object that stores the state), and the Caretaker (the object that requests the save and restore operations).
